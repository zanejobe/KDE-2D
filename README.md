# KDE-2D
Makes KDE contour plots of xy data using seaborn-jointplot.

`density_countour.py` is the main file that does the countouring (Thanks to Ross Meyer (https://github.com/rgmyr) for doing the heavy lifting here)

'2019NewPlots' is an example of a jupyter notebook that imports data and makes nice plots
